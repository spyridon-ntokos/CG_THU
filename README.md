## 2d project: Nine Men's Morris 

- [Overview / Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_men%27s_morris)
- Implemented in C++ / OpenGL using [freeGLUT](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
- Inspiration from [yadav-rahul](https://github.com/yadav-rahul/Nine-Mens-Morris) 's approach (JavaScript)

### Instructions to run it:
- Clone or download the repo contents
- Create a separate folder and just copy inside the .exe and .dll files
- Run the .exe, hopefully it will recognize the .dll libraries located in the same path and run as intended
